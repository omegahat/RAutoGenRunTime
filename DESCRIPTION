Title: Run-time support for automated interfaces to R
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Depends: bitops, methods
Imports: bitops
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu>
Description: The package provides classes, methods, functions and 
  compiled C code used by automatically generated interfaces 
  from R to C/C++ code using the RGCCTranslationUnit from the 
  omegahat.org project.
  Many of the functions can also be used in other dynamic/programmatic interfaces,
  e.g. Rffi and RGCCTUFFI., and generally when interacting with native code.
  These functions are separate from the RGCCTranslationUnit package as that is used
  to programmatically generate the binding/wrapper code. This can be done once
  without actually invoking any of the native routines in a target native library.
  This package, however, is used at run-time. So we don't need the RGCCTranslationUnit
  package at that moment in time, but do need the functions that programmatically code
  refers to.
