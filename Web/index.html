<h1>The RAutoGenRunTime package</h1>
<p align=right>Last Release:
 <a href="RAutoGenRunTime_0.3-0.tar.gz"> 0.3-0</a> (<font color="red">26 Jan 2011</font>)


<p>
This package provides functions and classes to support
interfaces to native routines in C and C++ that
are programmatically generated.
The generated code requires supporting helper functions to simplify
the generated code and this package provides those functions.

<p>
In most cases, this package is merely a required/dependent package
that other packages require. In that respect, it will be
install automatically via <code>install.packages</code>.

<p>


<h2>Documentation</h2> There are help pages for all of the functions.
For the most part, users of this package do not need to concern
themselves with the details of the functions in this package as the
programmatically generated code provides, by design, an opaque
interface to native code.  However, the functionality in this package
can be reused by others interfacing to native code.
